To begin the application, run mainGUI.py in GUI folder

Once in the app, you have to create an account through the new user button.

Only a username and password is necessary and will be inputted into the database.

After creating an account, use the username and password to login into the application.

This will lead you to the search bar, this will allow you to search locations, for example
inputting mall will give you two options, "Grand Uber Mall" and "Uberland Central Mall".

If you submit the search bar without inputting, it will reveal all the locations.

Clicking on the destination you want to go on will reveal its information, for example
clicking on "Grand Uber Mall" will reveal the statistics about traffic, cost and distance.

To end the application there is a log out button on the left corner of the search bar page.
